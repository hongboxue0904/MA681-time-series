Time Series Assignment

Read chapter 2 in A Little Book of R For Time Series, doing the examples that are used in the book as illustrations.

Apply what you have learned to build time series models for the series wine.dat, strikes.dat, death.dat, and lake.dat.

You use what ever organization you want for this assignment, but I recommend making a markdown document.  You'll find an example in the github folder for this section of the course.
